# PromptCraft-An-AI-Powered-Team-Building-Initiative
# Eexecutive Summary
PromptCraft is an innovative team engagement solution that leverages cutting-edge AI image generation technology to create an interactive, educational, and collaborative experience for employees. This gamified approach combines artificial intelligence literacy with team building, fostering creativity, communication, and critical thinking skills within the workplace.
# Solution Overview
What is PromptCraft?

PromptCraft is a reverse-engineering challenge game where participants analyze AI-generated images to deduce the original text prompts that created them. Think of it as a creative puzzle where employees become digital detectives, using visual clues to reconstruct the thinking behind AI-generated artwork.

In Simple Terms: One person creates a secret phrase (like "a cat wearing a tiny top hat"), uses AI to generate an image from that phrase, then shows only the image to others. The challenge is for everyone else to guess what the original phrase was just by looking at the picture
# Technical Implementation

Technology Stack

1) AI Engine: Imagen-4.0-generate-001 (Google Gemini)
2) Frontend: React-based user interface
3) Backend: FastAPI framework
4) Features: Real-time leaderboard, timer functionality, individual scoring system

Game Mechanics

Setup Phase:

1) Individual participation model with rotating roles
2) Each participant takes turns as the "Prompt Creator"
3) Time-limited rounds with competitive scoring

Gameplay Process:

1) Prompt Creation: The active player devises a concise, creative text prompt (3-10 words)
2) Image Generation: AI processes the prompt and generates a corresponding image
3) Challenge Phase: Other participants analyze the image and submit their best guess for the original prompt
4) Scoring: Points awarded based on accuracy and response speed, with real-time leaderboard updates
